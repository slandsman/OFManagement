SendURLtoOF is an automator action to send a Chrome tab's URL to the omnifocus inbox. 
It should be used as a workflow action for the most flexibility.

The way I have used it is as a service. To do so:

1. Compile the SendURLtoOF project in XCode
2. Open automator and create a new Service
3. To the action for the service to SendURLtoOF 
	(should show up once you compile it in XCode)
4. Set the input to no input
5. Save the service with a meaningful name
5. Go into Automator -> Services -> Services Preferences ...
6. Find and select the new service you just created in the list
7. Double click to the right of the service name and put in a keyboard shortcut

With this setup, you should be able to easily put URLs from chrome into OmniFocus
